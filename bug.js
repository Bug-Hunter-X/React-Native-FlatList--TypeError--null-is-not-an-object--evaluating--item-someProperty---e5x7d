This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render items that contain null or undefined values.  It often manifests as a blank space where an item should be, or a crash with an error like `TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'item.someProperty')`. This is especially problematic if your data source is asynchronous or involves complex transformations.
